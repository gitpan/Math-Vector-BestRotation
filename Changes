Revision history for Math-Vector-BestRotation

0.001   Sun Jan 31 18:34:49 NZDT 2010
        Functionality that I had in mind is implemented. Test suite coverage
        is not bad. Documentation is sparse, though. The methods are
        documented, but SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION are empty.

0.002	Tue Feb  2 09:53:40 NZDT 2010
	Changed namespace from  from Math::BestRotation to
	Math::Vector::BestRotation.

0.003	Tue Feb  2 13:50:03 NZDT 2010
	The matrix R is stored internally as a list during data input. This
	speeds up the input considerably.

0.004	Wed Feb  3 09:02:57 NZDT 2010
	Fix: Makefile.PL and README still required Class::Accessor although it
	is not used any more.

0.005	Thu Feb  4 16:19:32 NZDT 2010
	- Better protection against pathological cases.
	- New method best_flipped_rotation.
