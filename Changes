Revision history for Math-Vector-BestRotation

0.009	Sun Feb 14 12:30:24 NZDT 2010
	- rotation_axis and rotation_angle accept "foreign" matrices.
	- Docu fixes.

0.008   Wed Feb 10 11:52:00 NZDT 2010
	- Docu fixes and extension.
	- Methods rotation_axis and rotation_angle.

0.007	Mon Feb  8 17:10:54 NZDT 2010
	Documentation almost complete.

0.006	Mon Feb  8 12:22:42 NZDT 2010
	- Fixed and extended documentation.
	- New method add_many_pairs.
	- The test suite checks now explicitly for a few examples that the
	  result is really (close to) the best one. This comes at the price of
	  a lot of tests, though.

0.005	Thu Feb  4 16:19:32 NZDT 2010
	- Better protection against pathological cases.
	- New method best_flipped_rotation.

0.004	Wed Feb  3 09:02:57 NZDT 2010
	Fix: Makefile.PL and README still required Class::Accessor although it
	is not used any more.

0.003	Tue Feb  2 13:50:03 NZDT 2010
	The matrix R is stored internally as a list during data input. This
	speeds up the input considerably.

0.002	Tue Feb  2 09:53:40 NZDT 2010
	Changed namespace from  from Math::BestRotation to
	Math::Vector::BestRotation.

        Functionality that I had in mind is implemented. Test suite coverage
        is not bad. Documentation is sparse, though. The methods are
        documented, but SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION are empty.
