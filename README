Vector-Math-BestRotation

This module takes two equally sized sets of vectors and calculates the best
orthogonal transformation to turn one of the vector sets into the
other. "Best" means here to minimize the root mean square deviation between
the sets.

An orthogonal transformation can be a rotation or a rotation combined with a
reflection. If this is desired also the best rotation or the best flipped
rotation can be calculated.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

Math::Vector::BestRotation depends on the following modules:
    Carp,                 tested with module version 1.08
    Math::MatrixReal,	  tested with module version 2.05

Math::Vector::BestRotation requires Perl version 5.8.8. This is because it has
not been tested with older versions of Perl although it is likely that it
works at least with all 5.8 versions.
